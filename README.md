## Problem Statement

How can College Board increase SAT participation rates in North Dakota?

## Executive Summary

Based on current trends in payments and requirements for the SAT and ACT across the nation, it is clear that both of these methods can severely increase the rate at which North Dakota students participate in the SAT.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Because of the strong correlation between paying for the tests and participation rates, we recommend that College Board try first to pay for the SAT in North Dakota to incentivize students to take the SAT.  In the absence of paying for the test, the next more exhaustive option is to attempt to have the state of North Dakota mandate the SAT as a requirement for graduation.  If either of these measures take effect, the SAT participation rates for North Dakota students will rise markedly.
